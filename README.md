## Problem Definition

College students nowadays are facing increasing exposure to urban crimes. Various measures have been instituted by both campus and governmental authorities in recent years to enforce studentsâ€™ safety. Our team believes that amidst general success, however, there remains a blind spot. The safety measureâ€¯for students living off-campus largely depends on their living situation and its surroundings, but none of the existing apartment listing sites such as Apartments.com offer truly robust functionalities in this regard.â€¯â€¯We attempt to take into account the fact that peopleâ€™s safety is affected by their daily activities in the city as they travel to campuses, workplaces, local groceries, pharmacies, gyms and other entities. 


## Solution

The goal of our project is to create a more dynamically safety-oriented apartment listing site that considers each property listing not as a fixed location, but as a web of routes centered at the apartment building and expanding into the wider neighborhood. Put formally, for each apartment building within a user-defined radius, our application will compute a safety score by combining the safety score of its location and of all the routes between this building and userâ€™s most frequented locations.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you have `npm` and `node` installed on your machine. You can check by running:
```
npm -v
node -v
```

### Installation

1. Clone the depository by running the following lines in terminal:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gtfiveguys/atl-living-safe-00.git
    cd atl-living-safe-00
    ```

2. Install packages.

    Run the following line to install packages in the frontend:
    ```
    cd atl-living-safe-00/client
    npm install
    ```
    Run the following line to install packages in the backend:
    ```
    cd atl-living-safe-00/server
    npm install
    ```

3. Create your own access tokens.

    1. Google Maps APIs
        * Register a <a href="https://developers.google.com/">Google Developers account</a> if you do not have one already.
        * Create a Google API key on <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/overview?project=empirical-oven-327821">Google Maps Platform</a> to be able to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview">Maps JavaScript API</a>.
        * Store the **API key** on your local machine.
    2. MongoDB Database
        * Register a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register">MongoDB account</a> if you do not have one already.
        * Sign in to MongoDB Atlas and create a new cluster or use an existing one.
        * Go to "Database Access" under "SECURITY" in the left-hand side panel and **add a new database user**. This should be the admin who has full control over the database.
        * Go back to cluster, click "Connect" and copy the **connection string**. Make sure to replace any required variables. Store it on your local machine.
    3. Google Sign In
        * Go to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials">Credentials page</a> on Google Cloud Platform.
        * Click **Create credentials -> OAuth Client ID**.
        * Select the **Web application** application type.
        * Name your OAuth 2.0 client, add http://localhost:3000 to **Authorized JavaScript origins** and http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback to **Authorized redirect URIs**, and click **Create**.
        * Copy and store **Client ID** and **Client secret** on your local machine.

## Usage

1. To start the frontend server:
    Paste the Google Maps API key you created earlier at `<Your Google Maps API key>`:
    ```
    export REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=<Your Google Maps API key>
    ```
    In the same terminal window, run the following lines:
    ```
    cd atl-living-safe/client
    npm start
    ```
2. To start the backend server:
    Create a `config.env` file in the `atl-living-safe-00/server/config` folder and paste all other tokens you created earlier into it. **Please do NOT change the variable names.**
    ```
    PORT = 5000
    MONGO_URI = <MongoDB connection string>
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = <Google Client ID>
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = <Google Client secret>
    SESSION_SECRET = <anything you like>
    ```
    **Open a new terminal window** and run the following lines:
    ```
    cd atl-living-safe/server
    npm run dev
    ```
    You should now have two terminal windows, each running a server.

3. If `react-script` hasn't already opened a new page in your browser window, go to http://localhost:3000.

4. You're all set! ðŸŽ‰
